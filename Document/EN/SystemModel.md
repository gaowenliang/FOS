#Abstract

Forest Operating System (FOS) is a concurrently, distributed, 
cuttable, real-time operating system framwork.

It is contructed form hardware level, to application level.

#Memory Management Unit (MMU)

##Brief
In FOS, every computing Node is contructed by a core unit whitch is a MMU.
FOS's MMU can be a soft implementation, 
a hard implementation or a mixed implementation.

In order to actrualize this unit easily, 

MMU's I/O is mulitable,
